        <h1>About Pavel Asanov</h1>
        <p>Pavel Asanov is a business executive, repeat entrepreneur, and startup mentor who has built, scaled and exited multiple early-stage and growth-stage ventures. With more than two decades of expertise in product development, go-to-market, and business operations, Pavel is a trusted resource for companies in pre- and post-MVP phases that are looking to bring their products to market, expand into new geographies or segments, or accelerate their pace of innovation.</p>
     
        <p>Currently, Pavel is the Chief Operating Officer of Finta Inc., a rapid-growth fintech company that was a blockchain-based equity management platform at the time. As COO, Pavel steered product development for the bootstrapped venture alongside a team of 5 that successfully launched Finta’s services. Most notably, he led the development of a proof-of-concept token for managing a capitalization table on an Ethereum blockchain through changes to ERC-20. He also headed the product’s go-to-market strategy to enter new markets successfully, structure key business partnerships, and guide all aspects of regulatory compliance to secure necessary permissions and approvals.</p>
        
        <p> Earlier in his career, Pavel co-founded an entrepreneurial venture named Sound Facets LLC – a fully licensed burglar alarm security company that serviced a portfolio of both residential and commercial customers. Serving as Managing Partner from the company’s inception to his exit in 2018, he evolved the venture from the ground up to $5M in ARR. This growth was achieved through a mix of both organic initiatives, including new market entry and service expansion, as well as partnerships with leading players, including ADI, Alarm.com, and Telguard. </p>
        
        <p>Pavel initiated his career as an entrepreneur in Uzbekistan with the launch of Mikro-tech. As a personal computer integration and distribution company, Mikro-tech became a pioneering channel partner for Intel within the region. After working at Mikro-tech for 3 years, Pavel immigrated to the USA.</p>
        
        <p>Outside of his professional endeavors, Pavel is a Start-up Mentor with the Macquarie University Incubator and Founder Institute Incubator, where he works with promising founders to refine their ideas and shape viable strategies for product development and go-to-market. Over the course of a decade, Pavel has helped 200+ businesses successfully launch products across multiple industries and geographies. <a href="https://pasanov.com/pavel-asanov-startups.html">You can find a list of some of the startups Pavel mentored here</a>.</p>
